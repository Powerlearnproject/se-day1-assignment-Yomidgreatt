#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the application of engineering principles, methods, and tools to design and maintain high-quality and reliable software.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
i.	The development of programming languages (e.g., Fortran, C) – In this era, the first compilers were defined; operating systems were non-interactive. These primitive environments continued evolving up to the definition of the first low-level Computer Aided Software Engineering tools (CASE tools) facilitating interactive editing, compiling, and debugging.
ii.	The establishment of software engineering as a discipline in the 1960s and the advent of structured programming in the 1970s aimed to reduce risk during development and improve quality and productivity. Software development methodologies appeared to define and monitor software building. An important contribution of this stage was the formal modeling approach that enables implementation automation.
iii.	The rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s – In this era, the dominion of hardware over software ended. Personal computers arrived and opened the fields of computer applications. The software development process would now comprehensively address analysis and design from the specification. Graphical user interface and visual programming brought software closer to customers. The use of structured family and data modeling methodologies was extended


List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
-	Requirements: Gathering and documenting user needs and system requirements.
-	Design: Creating high-level and detailed designs of the software architecture and user interface.
-	Implementation: Writing code and building the software according to the design specifications.
-	Testing: Conducting various tests to ensure the software meets quality standards and functional requirements.
-	Deployment: Releasing the software to users or customers.
-	Maintenance: Providing ongoing support, updates, and enhancements to the software after deployment.


Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall is a linear, sequential methodology that limits divergence from the project plan at different stages in the SDLC. It emphasizes meticulous planning and execution.
Agile, on the other hand, is characterized by incremental and iterative work cadences. It offers flexibility, collaboration and adaptability, allowing teams to change the course of a project and incorporate new feedback.


Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
- Software Developer: Responsible for writing code and implementing software solutions.
  - Quality Assurance Engineer: Ensures software quality by designing and executing test plans.
  - Project Manager: Oversees the planning, execution, and delivery of software projects.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
- Integrated Development Environments (IDEs):  This is software suites that provide comprehensive tools for writing, debugging, and testing code (e.g., Visual Studio, Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA).
- Version Control Systems (VCS): This is software tools for tracking changes to source code and coordinating work among team members (e.g., Git, Subversion).


What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
-	Changing Requirements: Requirements may change during the development cycle, leading to scope creep and project delays.
-	Tight Deadlines: Pressure to deliver software products on schedule can result in rushed development and compromised quality.
-	Technical Debt: Accrued from shortcuts or suboptimal solutions, technical debt can impede future development efforts and increase maintenance costs.
-	Managing stakeholders: There may be multiple stakeholders with different goals and priorities, making it difficult to satisfy everyone’s requirements.
-	Handling ambiguity: Requirements may be ambiguous, inconsistent, or incomplete, making it difficult for engineers to understand what the system should do.


Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
-	Unit Testing: Testing individual components or modules of software. This allow too identify and addressing bugs early
-	Integration Testing: Testing interactions between different components or subsystems. This allow to identify and rectify issue before they reach production and also improve software quality.
-	System Testing: Testing the entire software system as a whole. This ensure that system meets all requirements and behave as expected by end users.
-	Acceptance Testing: Testing the software against user requirements to ensure it meets user needs. This helps in verifying usability, functionality and overall satisfaction.


#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is all about crafting questions or statements to get the best possible responses from AI models. 
It’s important because it helps to avoid asking vague and ambiguous questions that may bring confusing answers. Prompt engineering makes questions clear and specific so that AI understand exactly what you need. 


Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
Vague Prompt: Tell me how to prepare Rice.
Clear prompt: Tell me how to prepare Fried Rice.
The vague prompt here will list all the types of rice preparations which may be too much and irrelevant to you because you are looking for a specific kind of rice preparation, but instead, tell the specific rice you intend to prepare which will make the AI to give direct and concise details about what you ask for.
